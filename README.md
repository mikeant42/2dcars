# Car game test 

# TODO
- car deformation (using shaders, sprite interpolation with different deform stages??)
- high speed collisions
- car explosions
- dirt/dust, tracks, rain
- dialogue system
- ui and title screen
- ai accelerates too fast
    - the separation behavior makes them jerk around a bit, and they do things that cars can't do
    - ai needs to handle crashes e.g. new behavior that reverses then transitions to default
- mouse steering??
- player needs more drifting (complete overhaul of player car physics)
- method to send ai vehicles spinning/slipping around

# Civilian Cars
- use a flow map + separate behaviors??
