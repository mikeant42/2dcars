# racing cars
not sure where to go with this one, just has some ai, basic driving and other mini projects in it.

# TODO
1. game mechanics. 
2. ai work
3. overall art/design work

# art
- neon with patterns
- digital art, using 3d renders for models
- sharp polygons, square, triangular models with no curves


# ai
- wobbly steering when close to destination
- handle crashes e.g. reverse when needed
- add racing behavior

# general
- car deformation (using shaders, sprite interpolation with different deform stages)  (easy/medium)
- car explosions (easy/medium)
- ui and title screen (medium)
- player needs more drifting (complete overhaul of player car physics) (medium/hard)

# Civilian Cars
- use a flow map + separate behaviors??
