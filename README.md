# TODO
1. game mechanics. build the game around car chases? races? pickups? what sort of game will this be? what art and flow do i need in order to make it fun?
2. ai work
3. broken reflections in puddles for anyone but the player (medium)
4. overall art/design work

- blade-runner top down asthetic - find reference art

# ai
- wobbly steering when close to destination
- handle crashes e.g. reverse when needed

# general
- car deformation (using shaders, sprite interpolation with different deform stages)  (easy/medium)
- car explosions (easy/medium)
- ui and title screen (medium)
- player needs more drifting (complete overhaul of player car physics) (medium/hard)

# Civilian Cars
- use a flow map + separate behaviors??
